My previous attempts at using AI nearly extensively to code (with an algo trading python bot and a desktop JSON schema editing tool) did not end up great. I wanted a quick win and within 10 minutes I got a successfully working version of the game 2048 but the numbers go up to 480.

Why 480? Thats the number of months in a typical 40 year career and it's remarkably small.

It took approximately 8 iterations, starting with Grok 3 and pivoting over to Chat GPT 4o. It took longer to make the repo and this post so it's promising!
