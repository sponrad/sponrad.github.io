<h2>I am an engineer in North San Diego, California.</h2>
<p>I have a strong physics and civil engineering background which gives me a unique look at problems in software projects I work on.</p>

<p>Some technology I like to use:</p>
<ul class="tech-list">
<li>Python and Django</li>
<li>iOS with Swift</li>
<li>Emacs</li>
<li>The Command Line</li>
<li>Front-end stuff: HTML, Javscript, jQuery, CSS</li>
<li>Meteor, I want to use this more!</li>
<li>React and React Native, these are so cool</li>
</ul>
