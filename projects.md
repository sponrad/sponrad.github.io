Since 2011. In loose order of activeness.

**<img src="/assets/crypto-checker.png" width="75" style="border-radius: 5px;"> Crypto Checker**

Crypto Checker is a simple cryptocurrency price and portfolio value tracker. It's bare-bones (a plus compared to other offerings!), simple to use, and also shows earnings from interest on cryptocurrency holdings. [Privacy policy](/privacy-crypto-checker/).

[iOS](), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sponrad.cryptointerestchecker)

**[<img src="/assets/fqms.png" width="197">](http://freeqms.com)**

FreeQMS is an electronic quality management system (QMS) SaaS with a compelling free plan (rare in the industry) and several modules that can be toggled on or off. Built with Python and Django and hosted on Google App Engine and CloudSQL Postgres.

**[<img src="/assets/sr-s.png" width="75"> SendRecurring](http://www.sendrecurring.com)**

A successful SaaS that sends scheduled email and text reminders. I created this entirely from the bottom up using Python on Google App Engine. I continue to maintain it and create new features.

**[<img src="/assets/birdgame.png" width="75"> The Bird Game (Github repo)](https://github.com/sponrad/thebirdgame)**

A Unity game I made that I'm proud of. The Bird Game is a blatant knockoff of Pacifist Mode in Geometry Wars (which I love).

**[<img src="/assets/DayPage.png" width="75"> Daypage](https://daypage.co)**

A productivity journal that is a work in progress. Journaling what you have accomplished makes you motivated and keeps teams on track. Created in Python/Django, hosted on Heroku with a lot of third party APIs.

**[<img src="/assets/fficon.png" width="75"> Flash Force](http://www.flashforceapp.com)**

A mobile app that allows groups of people to flash patterns of light together in sync. I am in charge of app development and created the timing system. I made the iOS app using Swift, the server is Python/Django based, and the Android app is in progress, using Java.

**[Menuflick](http://www.menuflick.com)** - Crowdsourced restaurant menus using reviews that are mad libbed by users. Fun project that didn't really get any traction but still available. I was in charge of the backend and some of the frontend work. Built using Python and hosted on Google App Engine.

**[DensityPro](http://www.densitypro.com)** - Software that helps with contruction density testing during grading. Built using PHP with Laravel. I have nothing but good to say about Laravel but Python wins my heart.

**[ReviewCivilPe](http://www.reviewcivilpe.com)** - Blog that helps people preparing to pass the Professional Engineers exam for Civil Engineering.

**[Wresy](http://www.wresy.com)** - I worked with a company that installs water recycling systems that recycle usable water into sprinkler systems. I created software for an Arduino unit that read the tank levels, detected which tanks to draw water from while sprinklers are running, and also had a networking component that sent values to a Django powered website to monitor installed tanks.
