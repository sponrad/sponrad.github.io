  <h3>I am an engineer in North San Diego, California.</h3>
  <p>I have a strong physics and civil engineering background which gives me a unique look at a lot of problems that arise in projects I work on!</p>
  
  <p>I really like to build stuff and I am good at doing that with code. I fall in the back-end developer camp, but given a design I can flesh out some mean front-end work also. Check out my [projects](/projects) to see some of the things I have worked on.</p>
  
  <p>Technology that I like to use (the list I don't like to use is undisclosed):</p>
  <ul class="tech-list">
  <li>Python and Django</li>
  <li>Front-end stuff: HTML, Javscript, Jquery, CSS</li>
  <li>Emacs</li>
  <li>THE COMMAND LINE</li>
  <li>iOS with Swift is not THAT BAD!</li>
  <li>Meteor, I want to use this more!</li>
  <li>React and React Native, these are so cool</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Projects:</p>
  <ul class="project-list">
  <li></li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
